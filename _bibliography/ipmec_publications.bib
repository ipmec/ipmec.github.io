  abstract = {Reliability requirements are critical in applications used in harsh environments. Although commercial microprocessors offer a good trade-off between cost, size, and performance, they must be tailored to meet tight reliability requirements. This work focuses on the reliability of a real space data intensive application. As a case study we have selected an ESA space benchmark that processes images of a near infrared detector (NIR-Hawaii) involving a large quantity of data with a high computational load. The reliability of the system has been accomplished with the improvement of a macro-synchronized lockstep hardening technique, taking into account the specific special needs of data intensive applications. The microprocessor implementation platform is a commercial dual-core ARM cortex A9 microprocessor. Extensive fault injection campaigns have been carried out in both memory and register file to evaluate the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate the high reliability of the proposed hardened system, with error detection capabilities of 100~\% and improved system recovery capabilities.},

However, properly leveraging the computational resources of graphical processors is a very challenging task. In this paper, we use this kind of device to parallelize FE-IIEE (Finite Element-Iterative Integral Equation Evaluation), a non-standard finite element mesh truncation technique introduced by two of the authors. This application is computationally very demanding due to the amount, size and complexity of the data involved in the procedure. Besides, an efficient implementation becomes even more difficult if the parallelization has to maintain the complex workflow of the original code. The proposed implementation using CUDA applies different optimization techniques to improve performance. These include leveraging the fastest memories of the GPU and increasing the granularity of the computations to reduce the impact of memory access. We have applied our parallel algorithm to two real radiation and scattering problems demonstrating speedups higher than 140 on a state-of-the-art GPU.},

  abstract = {Achieving maximum parallel performance on multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs is a challenging task depending on multiple factors. These include, for example, the number and granularity of the computations or the use of the memories of the devices. In this paper, we assess those factors by evaluating and comparing different parallelizations of the same problem on a multiprocessor containing a CPU with 40 cores and four P100 GPUs with Pascal architecture. We use, as study case, the convolutional operation behind a non-standard finite element mesh truncation technique in the context of open region electromagnetic wave propagation problems. A total of six parallel algorithms implemented using OpenMP and CUDA have been used to carry out the comparison by leveraging the same levels of parallelism on both types of platforms. Three of the algorithms are presented for the first time in this paper, including a multi-GPU method, and two others are improved versions of algorithms previously developed by some of the authors. This paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation of the parallel algorithms on a radar cross-sectional prediction problem. Results show that performance obtained on the GPU clearly overcomes those obtained in the CPU, much more so if we use multiple GPUs to distribute both data and computations. Accelerations close to 30 have been obtained on the CPU, while with the multi-GPU version accelerations larger than 250 have been achieved.},

As these SoCs grow in prevalence, it becomes crucial to analyse their computational performance, energy consumption, and reliability, especially for safety-critical applications. A key factor examined in this paper is the SoC's neutron radiation tolerance. This is explored by subjecting a parallel version of matrix multiplication, which has been offloaded to various hardware components via OpenMP, to neutron irradiation. Through this approach, this researcher establishes a correlation between the SoC's reliability and its computational and energy performance. The analysis enables the identification of an optimal workload distribution strategy, considering factors such as execution time, energy efficiency, and system reliability. Experimental results reveal that, while the GPU executes matrix multiplication tasks more rapidly and efficiently than the CPU, using both components only marginally reduces execution time. Interestingly, GPU usage significantly increases the SoC's critical section, leading to an escalated error rate for both Detected Unrecoverable Errors (DUE) and Silent Data Corruptions (SDC), with the CPU showing a higher average number of affected elements per SDC.},

To tackle problems of this kind, mesh truncation techniques are required, which may lead to the use of high computational resources. In fact, electrically large radiation problems can only be tackled using massively parallel computational resources. Different types of multi-core machines are commonly employed in diverse fields of science for accelerating a number of applications. However, properly managing their computational resources becomes a very challenging task. On the one hand, we present a hybrid message passing interface + OpenMP-based acceleration of a mesh truncation technique included in a FEM code for electromagnetism in a high-performance computing cluster equipped with 140 compute nodes.

While traditional acoustic processing applications have been developed on high-performance computing platforms equipped with expensive multi-channel audio interfaces, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm requires the use of more flexible and energy-efficient systems. Although software-based platforms exist for implementing general-purpose neural networks, they are not optimized for sound classification, wasting energy and computational resources. In this work, we have used FPGAs to develop an ad hoc system where only the hardware needed for our application is synthesized, resulting in faster and more energy-efficient circuits. The results show that our developments are accelerated by a factor of 35 compared to a software-based implementation on a Raspberry Pi.},

Three commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) SoCs from NVIDIA, namely, the Jetson Nano with Tegra X1 SoC and two models of Jetson Orin Nano with 4- and 8-GB memory, were subjected to high-flux neutron radiation. The research assesses the number and duration of reboots caused by SEFIs and their consequent impact on overall system downtime. Results reveal that the reboot process has a significantly higher cross section compared to application-level operations such as matrix multiplication and neural network inference, which highlights its vulnerability to radiation. The study further categorizes the reboots based on their triggers and identifies common system messages linked to radiation-induced errors. It also shows that different phases of the boot flow have different radiation reliabilities. The findings underscore the importance of evaluating boot processes in radiation-intensive environments, especially for safety-critical applications where minimizing downtime is crucial.},

This study focuses on evaluating the soft-error sensitivity of two distinct versions of LU decomposition algorithms implemented on two very different GPUs---a low-power SoC embedded GPU and a high-performance massively parallel GPU. Through extensive fault injection campaigns on both GPUs, we examine the vulnerability of the algorithms, identify error causes, and determine critical code components requiring enhanced protection. The experiments reveal that most single bit flip fault injections in the instruction results lead to erroneous outcomes or unrecoverable errors. Notably, efficient GPU resource utilisation can increase the number of masked errors, thereby enhancing error resilience. Additionally, while different parts of the code exhibit similar error occurrence types and rates, the propagation of errors to elements within the result matrix differs significantly.},

This work considers an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) approach for accurate estimation of angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure (AoD) parameters from frequency-domain channel observations. Our approach is based on the implementation of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): a residual CNN (ResNet) and a U-Net CNN.

We performed the experiments in a low-power NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano platform and evaluated the effect of modifying the frequencies of its CPU and GPU on the performance of the inference process, both in terms of execution time and energy consumption. Experimental results showed that the U-Net model is more power consuming, but as it is faster, it consumes less energy per channel.},
